# USNamesAnalysis
Repo for my project to understand US baby naming trends

# Purpose

I set out to understand baby naming trends in the US. I noticed names can be associated with a cohort. As that cohort ages, the age associated with the name becomes older. This led me to the question I set out to answer in this project.

Can I predict the next top names? If I can, I could avoid giving a child a name that will become too common. Alternatively, I could give a name that will make my child seem somewhat more youthful throughout their life.

Additionally, I am setting out to be able to approximate the expected age of someone given their name. I use the period life tables to estimate how many of people with the name have passed. This obviously fails to account for migration.
